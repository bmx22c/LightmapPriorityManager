# Lightmap Priority Manager

Lightmap Priority Manager, like its name says, aims to help you manage blocks and items lightmap priority, giving you more control over the lightmap calculations !
It is a fork of the [Items & Blocks Counter](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/blocksitemscounter) plugin by Beu.

## Features (that the original plugin doesn't have)
- Change lightmap priority for items (vanilla and non vanilla)
- Change lightmap priority for blocks (vanilla or custom blocks)
- Batch change lightmap priority
- Scans and displays what lightmap priority items and blocks have
- A lot of options

## Settings
Default settings work perfectly but you can customize a few things, including:
- Changing buttons color when lightmap is found (after a scan)
- Enable or disable the lightmap found indicator (after a scan)
- Enable or disable the lightmap scan
- Enable or disable the lightmap priority next to the Filter bar
- Enable or disable the camera focus button (from the original plugin)
- Enable or disable the 3 kind of notifications
	- Lightmap applied notification
	- Processing from Filter bar notification
	- Scanning notification
- Enable or disable the 4 kind of columns from the main table listing everything
	- Type (Items / Blocks)
	- Source (In-Game, Embedded, Local)
	- Size
	- Count
	
## Note
The lightmap scan is not the fastest, if anyone has a better scanning algorithm, please let me know on Discord `bmx22c#0001`.
